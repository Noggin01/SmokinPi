Smokin'Pi
========

The Smokin'Pi is a propane smoker controller based on a Raspberry Pi Model B.  The Smokin'Pi contols the temperature of the smoker cabinet by driving a multi-turn servo motor attached to a needle valve on the propane line.  Flame is detected by a K-Type thermocouple placed in the burner's flame.  Cabinet and meat temperatures are monitored through the use of cheap thermistor based probes.  The Smokin'Pi also provides a web interface to allow remote monitoring and control of the smoker.
